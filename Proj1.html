    <p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and <mark>coherent</mark>, and are all related to a single topic.

    <p>Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. <abbr title="World Health Organization" style="color: red">Who </abbr> is an international organization. A paragraph could <del>not</del> contain a series of brief examples or a single long illustration of a general point. It might describe a place, character, or process; narrate a series of events; compare or contrast two or more things; classify items into categories; or describe causes and effects. Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs share certain characteristics. One of the most important of these is a topic sentence.</p>
